* Welcome to BitPacket

BitPacket is a Python module that provides a simple objected-oriented
representation for data structures. The main purpose is to provide an
easy and extensible interface for building and parsing these structures
(e.g. network packets).

These are the three main features of BitPacket:

- Byte-oriented with support for bit fields.

- Same BitPacket definition can be used for packing and unpacking data.

- Comes with an extensible framework to customize BitPackets
  representation (e.g. text tables, Gtk widgets).
