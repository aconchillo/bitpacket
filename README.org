* Welcome to BitPacket

BitPacket is a Python module that provides a simple objected-oriented
representation of data structures. The main purpose is to provide an
easy and extensible interface for building and parsing these structures
(e.g. network packets).

These are the three main features of BitPacket:

- The same data structure can be used for both packing and unpacking a
  byte stream.
- Data structures can contain single bit fields.
- Provides and extensible framework to customize data representation
  (e.g. text tables, Gtk widgets).
