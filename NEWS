* Version 0.2.0 (2009/12/??)

** Changes:

   - BitVector is not needed anymore. Internal encoding and decoding
     of bits has been copied from the Construct project, thanks!
     (http://construct.wikispaces.com/)

   - Multiple outputs are now available as BitWriters. Basic text (old
     output), text tables and XML formats are available. Users can
     define new formats easily by implementing a new BitWriter.

   - Engineering values have been added. Engineering values are
     extracted from the real value by applying a calibration
     curve. This calibration might convert, for example, a digital
     value into a temperature. A calibration curve can be set to each
     BitFieldBase instance.

   - BitPacket sizes (BIT_SIZE, INTEGER_SIZE...) have been removed in
     favour of the Real and Integer classes (which are Value
     subclasses).

   - Value subclasses support endianness.
