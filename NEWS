* Version 0.2.0 (09/10/??)

** Changes:

   - BitVector is not needed anymore. Internal encoding and decoding
     of bits has been copied from the Construct project, thanks!
     (http://construct.wikispaces.com/)

   - BitField and BitStructure now inherit from the BitFieldBase
     abstract class.

   - Multiple outputs are now available as BitWriters. Basic text (old
     output), text tables and XML formats are available. Users can
     define new formats easily by implementing a new BitWriter.

   - Engineering values have been added. Engineering values are
     extracted from the real value by applying a calibration
     curve. This calibration might convert, for example, a digital
     value into a temperature. A calibration curve can be set to each
     BitFieldBase instance.

   - BitPacket sizes (BIT_SIZE, INTEGER_SIZE...) have been removed in
     favour of the BitFieldReal and BitFieldInteger classes.

   - BitFieldReal has floats and doubles subclasses.

   - BitFieldInteger has integer subclasses for 8 to 64 bit integers.

   - BitFieldStruct subclasses (BitFieldReal and BitFieldInteger)
     support endianness (using the built-in Pyhton struct module). By
     default network endianness is used (i.e. big-endian).
