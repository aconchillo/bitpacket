Welcome to BitPacket
====================

BitPacket is a Python module that provides a simple objected-oriented

easy and extensible interface for building and parsing these structures
(e.g. network packets).

These are the main features of BitPacket:

- Data can be packed/unpacked to/from bytes.
- Works with single bit fields.
- Provides and extensible framework to customize data representation.
- Allows meta-fields, that is, fields that depend on other fields.
